# Big Data Environment Setup (vagrant-virtualbox)
This project aims for building scripts for setting up the environments of the big data analytics with the technologies including hadoop, yarn, hive, spark and so on.

# Vagrant for Hadoop, Spark and Hive (V1)
=========================================

# Introduction

Vagrant project to spin up a single virtual machine running:

* Hadoop 2.7.2
* Hive 1.2.1
* Spark 2.1.0

The virtual machine will be running the following services:

* HDFS NameNode + NameNode
* YARN ResourceManager + JobHistoryServer + ProxyServer
* Hive metastore and server2
* Spark history server

# Getting Started

1. [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Download and install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
3. Run ```vagrant box add centos65 https://github.com/2creatives/vagrant-centos/releases/download/v6.5.1/centos65-x86_64-20131205.box```
4. Go to [releases](https://github.com/alexholmes/vagrant-hadoop-spark-hive/releases) and download and extract the latest source of this project.
5. In your terminal change your directory into the project directory (i.e. `cd vagrant-hadoop-spark-hive-<version>`).
6. Run ```vagrant up``` to create the VM.
7. Execute ```vagrant ssh``` to login to the VM.

# Web user interfaces

Here are some useful links to navigate to various UI's:

* YARN resource manager:  (http://10.211.55.101:8088)
* Job history:  (http://10.211.55.101:19888/jobhistory/)
* HDFS: (http://10.211.55.101:50070/dfshealth.html)
* Spark history server: (http://10.211.55.101:18080)
* Spark context UI (if a Spark context is running): (http://10.211.55.101:4040)

# Validating your virtual machine setup

To test out the virtual machine setup, and for examples of how to run
MapReduce, Hive and Spark, head on over to [VALIDATING.md](VALIDATING.md).

# Submit wordcount job on hadoop
To test wordcount plese run [scripts/wordcount.sh](scripts/wordcount.sh)
# Starting services in the event of a system restart

Currently if you restart your VM then the Hadoop/Spark/Hive services won't be
up (this is something I'll address soon).  In the interim you can run the
following commands to bring them up:

```
$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo -s
$ /vagrant/scripts/start-hadoop.sh
$ nohup hive --service metastore < /dev/null > /usr/local/hive/logs/hive_metastore_`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`.log 2>&1 </dev/null &
$ nohup hive --service hiveserver2 < /dev/null > /usr/local/hive/logs/hive_server2_`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`.log 2>&1 </dev/null &
$ /usr/local/spark/sbin/start-history-server.sh

```
